## Motivation and goals

This group is for all Dataverse community members interested in frontend development using the Dataverse API.

We are re architecting the Dataverse software to be more modular and flexible, and building a new frontend to replace the current one.
This group will focus on the new frontend, and the new API to support it.  

The goals of this group are to:
- Understand the needs of the community
- Share information about the new front end and the API as it is developed
